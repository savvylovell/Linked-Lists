# Linked-Lists
Implementation of linked list operations
The goal is part to implement Stack ADT using linked-list implementation. 
Then, to use Stack class to solve a practical problem.
Then, todevelop a new class, called Stack.java, to implement stack operations [push(e), pop(), top(), size(), isEmpty()]
Then, to develop a simple test program called TestStack.java to test each stack operation in class Stack. 
Then, to use class Stack.java to implement another program, called ReverseString.java, which prompts the user to enter a string of any length. Using class Stack, the program creates a stack object and uses the object to reverse the input string and display both the original input string and the revered string.
